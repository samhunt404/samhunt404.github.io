This effect was created using several particle emmitters, materials, and even some blueprints. I needed a simple, comic-book-esque explosion so I did the following:
-Created a base cloud using a fresnel effect and sufrace displacement on several large spheres to give the illusion of clouds.
-Added sparks with smoking trails that fly out of the explosion to give it more power.
-Modeled debris using Blender, and had it spewing out from the explosion.
-Added scorch marks where it's placed to really show how this interacts with the environment.
