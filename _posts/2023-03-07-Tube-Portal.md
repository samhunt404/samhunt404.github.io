I've been on a scifi kick recently and really enjoy the retro-futuristic visions of the 80s, colloqually known as Casette-Futurism. I came up with this idea of a tube monitor which would then turn into the portal as the player aproached. This effect was accomplished in 2 main parts, the mesh and the shader:

<object data="/assets/CRT.png" width="30%" height="30%"></object>
<object data="/assets/WithShader.gif" width="30%" height="30%"></object>
<object data="/assets/128CRT.png" width="30%" height="30%"></object>

The shader is a simple white noise texture scrolling on a pre-made texture containing a tiling texture of red, green, and blue circles to emulate the look of old tv static. This project was made in the Godot game engine, an open source alternative to Unity or Unreal that I enjoy using because it's not overly abstracted, and the documentation is really quite extensive.

The model was created in blender, the style was made to look old school military/government.

This effect was, of course, heavily inspired by the look and feel of the Portal game series. I imagined this could, potentially be a prototype portal built in the early days of Aperture science before they had lots of moon-rocks to make the portal-able surfaces.

I love the idea of a low tech version of something which wouldn't be possible with today's technology, a juxtaposition of the known, and unknown.
