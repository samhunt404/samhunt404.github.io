When I first saw what Vertex Animation Textures were capable of I was shocked, I had never seen such amazing animations and simulations run in real time. I wanted to learn how to use them, so I purchased an education liscense to Houdini and simulated a statue melting. I was suprised to find that the pipeline of exporting the simulation and importing it into Unreal was both easy, and decently well documented. Once I had the animation I used a simple blueprint to make it trigger when being shot by the player to show some interesting interaction. The statue's model is from the Museum of Classical Archaeology, and the scan was thanks to the Scan the World Project.
