This effect was really fun to create as it interacts with the environment around it. With simple artist adjustable end points, it can either shoot bolts that will spark off of nearby walls, or just to select capacitive and conductive locations. I modeled the coil in Blender to look like one you might find in a mad scientists lab. The bolts of lighting shooting out from the capacitor at the top of the coil were created in Photoshop. The rest of the effect uses a combination of blueprints and Niagara.
