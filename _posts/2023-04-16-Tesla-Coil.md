This effect was really fun to create as it interacts with the environment around it. With simple artist adjustable end points, it can either shoot bolts that will spark off of nearby walls, or just to select capacitive and conductive locations. All effects, models, textures, and effects were created by me using a mix of niagara and blueprints.
