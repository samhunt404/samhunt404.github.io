I envisioned a high-level warlock or space-centered wizard casting this spell and encompasing anything in it's area with some form of debuff and a large amount of damage. I used a simple projectile to start the effect, wherever it lands it will spawn one of these massive void-holes. The spheres being sucked into the hole are Niagara Particles, and the hole itself is a decal, so anything in it's path will be swallowed in this thick black. The shader on the player is similar to the one I used in the Space Crystal effect, I wanted to emphasize the space-esque nature of the spell.
