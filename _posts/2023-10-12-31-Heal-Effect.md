I wanted to show an effect that actually seems to affect the players model, I think showing things in the world is more interesting to gameplay than a UI change. I used niagara to show the player model growing plants out of it, as if it had a sudden burst of life thanks to the healing spell it cast. I also modeled a ring around the area and applied some vertex displacement to show very clearly the area of the spell. The character and animation are thanks to Adobe Mixamo.
