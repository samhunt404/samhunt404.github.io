I made this effect feeling inspired by the Stasis abilities in Destiny 2 as well as my favorite comic book artist Alex Ross. Ross uses interesting effects to convey certain  powers and abilities, one such effect is to blow out the highlighs and paint a bloom, while the shadows fade into a galaxy. I always loved this idea because as an art student the first thing you learn is that light is form and shadow is atmosphere, so controlling that atmosphere and emphasizing the light/form create a very dynamic and interesting result.
