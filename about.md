Hello, I am a current student at Utah Tech with a passion for games and VFX work. I founded the Game Making club at my school, and would love to work in the games industry. I have made several small games playeable on my [itch.io page][https://rende36.itch.io/].

If you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
